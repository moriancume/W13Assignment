            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to WorkInProgress! My name is Pedro Vieira Neves, and I'm thrilled to have you here. This website serves as a platform for me to share my creative projects, professional journey, and personal experiences. As a 21-year-old creative professional from Brazil, I believe in constant growth and development, and this website represents my ongoing journey towards becoming the best version of myself.</p>

            <p>Living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, I've had the opportunity to explore my passions and expand my horizons. Having spent five years in the United States, I gained valuable experiences and a deep appreciation for different cultures. It was during this time that I discovered my love for various activities, such as playing video games, watching movies (with "American Sniper" being my all-time favorite), hitting the gym, and engaging in soccer and basketball.</p>

            <p>Currently, I'm pursuing my academic goals at BYU-Idaho through BYU Pathway Connect. This educational journey has allowed me to further explore my creative pursuits and develop a diverse set of skills.</p>

            <p>I'm excited to hear from you and engage in meaningful conversations. Whether you have inquiries about my work, collaboration opportunities, or simply want to connect, don't hesitate to get in touch. Let's create something extraordinary together!</p>

            <p>Remember, WorkInProgress is a constantly evolving space, and I encourage you to check back regularly for updates on my latest projects and personal growth. Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey.</p>

            <p>Warm regards,</p>
            <p>Pedro Vieira Neves</p>
